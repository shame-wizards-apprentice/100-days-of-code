# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wireframing and ERD design for Emerald Marine Products, updated health logic for Wizards and Whiteboads. 

**Thoughts:** Removing the second API call for the code editor in W&W is proving more complicated than I anticipated--but getting a much better understanding of Redux and the structure of the front-end repo!

### Day 2: March 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wireframed 4 more pages for Emerald Marine Products, met with Hannah and came up with a lot of good suggestions for consolidation/streamlining his current website. Got rid of the scrollspy business on my portfolio and upddated light/dark mode shift for a smoother look/more visibility. 

**Thoughts:** I HATE CSS. I do NOT know why I can't get the links in my portfolio to change color, so I went with the path of least resistance and changed the light mode gradient so they didn't vibrate anymore. Am I sorry? A bit. Do I stand by it anyway? Absolutely. Feeling really good about the Emerald Marine Projects wireframes, and optimistic for the meeting tomorrow!

### Day 3: March 23rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: First pitch meeting with a real actual potential client!! Fixed MongoDB issues in W&W and finally got the health validation to work, so now it can't go below 0. Wrestled with Redux the rest of the afternoon, still can't get the keys component to refresh when the health state goes to zero. Back at it tomorrow!

**Thoughts:** Further study is needed with Redux. It's very useful, but every time I try to do something new with it, I find myself spending six hours googling it. The meeting went really well, though. He seemed into our ideas, and really seemed to listen and take in what we were saying about Wordpress not working for his particular website. Got some cool new interview prep resources I'll definitely look into tomorrow!

### Day 4: March 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed sorting algorithms and big O notation, spent most of the day preparing for my interview tomorrow. That counts, right?

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to talk to this company. Their mission is awesome, and it would be really cool for my first job to be something I actually believe in, and not. Y'know. Amazon.

### Day 5: March 25th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally solved the health rendering issues in W&W! All we needed was a simple useEffect hook. The interview with Hello Alice was awesome! They seem really cool. Fingers crossed for a tech interview! Also, Robert asked Hannah and I about some additional international customer pages for his website, so he seems to really be considering us.

**Thoughts:** The RPG issues took an embarrassingly long time to figure out, so hopefully we make more progress when we're all together tomorrow. Really excited about the interview, and super hopeful Robert decides to go ahead with our freelance project!

### Day 6: March 26th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Figured out why the level wasn't resetting properly in W&W, then managed to do a major refactor on the code editor component to get rid of the 2nd API call and reduce a 60-something line function down to 20 counting comments.

**Thoughts:** I LOVE REDUX. That is all.
