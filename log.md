# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wireframing and ERD design for Emerald Marine Products, updated health logic for Wizards and Whiteboads. 

**Thoughts:** Removing the second API call for the code editor in W&W is proving more complicated than I anticipated--but getting a much better understanding of Redux and the structure of the front-end repo!

### Day 2: March 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wireframed 4 more pages for Emerald Marine Products, met with Hannah and came up with a lot of good suggestions for consolidation/streamlining his current website. Got rid of the scrollspy business on my portfolio and upddated light/dark mode shift for a smoother look/more visibility. 

**Thoughts:** I HATE CSS. I do NOT know why I can't get the links in my portfolio to change color, so I went with the path of least resistance and changed the light mode gradient so they didn't vibrate anymore. Am I sorry? A bit. Do I stand by it anyway? Absolutely. Feeling really good about the Emerald Marine Projects wireframes, and optimistic for the meeting tomorrow!
