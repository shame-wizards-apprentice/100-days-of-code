# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wireframing and ERD design for Emerald Marine Products, updated health logic for Wizards and Whiteboads. 

**Thoughts:** Removing the second API call for the code editor in W&W is proving more complicated than I anticipated--but getting a much better understanding of Redux and the structure of the front-end repo!

### Day 2: March 22nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wireframed 4 more pages for Emerald Marine Products, met with Hannah and came up with a lot of good suggestions for consolidation/streamlining his current website. Got rid of the scrollspy business on my portfolio and upddated light/dark mode shift for a smoother look/more visibility. 

**Thoughts:** I HATE CSS. I do NOT know why I can't get the links in my portfolio to change color, so I went with the path of least resistance and changed the light mode gradient so they didn't vibrate anymore. Am I sorry? A bit. Do I stand by it anyway? Absolutely. Feeling really good about the Emerald Marine Projects wireframes, and optimistic for the meeting tomorrow!

### Day 3: March 23rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: First pitch meeting with a real actual potential client!! Fixed MongoDB issues in W&W and finally got the health validation to work, so now it can't go below 0. Wrestled with Redux the rest of the afternoon, still can't get the keys component to refresh when the health state goes to zero. Back at it tomorrow!

**Thoughts:** Further study is needed with Redux. It's very useful, but every time I try to do something new with it, I find myself spending six hours googling it. The meeting went really well, though. He seemed into our ideas, and really seemed to listen and take in what we were saying about Wordpress not working for his particular website. Got some cool new interview prep resources I'll definitely look into tomorrow!

### Day 4: March 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed sorting algorithms and big O notation, spent most of the day preparing for my interview tomorrow. That counts, right?

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to talk to this company. Their mission is awesome, and it would be really cool for my first job to be something I actually believe in, and not. Y'know. Amazon.

### Day 5: March 25th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally solved the health rendering issues in W&W! All we needed was a simple useEffect hook. The interview with Hello Alice was awesome! They seem really cool. Fingers crossed for a tech interview! Also, Robert asked Hannah and I about some additional international customer pages for his website, so he seems to really be considering us.

**Thoughts:** The RPG issues took an embarrassingly long time to figure out, so hopefully we make more progress when we're all together tomorrow. Really excited about the interview, and super hopeful Robert decides to go ahead with our freelance project!

### Day 6: March 26th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Figured out why the level wasn't resetting properly in W&W, then managed to do a major refactor on the code editor component to get rid of the 2nd API call and reduce a 60-something line function down to 20 counting comments.

**Thoughts:** I LOVE REDUX. That is all.

### Day 7: March 27th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Not much. Got the W&W modals to pop up over the game world instead of underneath it for reduced scrolling time (still need to fix mobile view).

**Thoughts:** I hate CSS. I hate CSS. I hate CSS.

### Day 8: March 28th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finally got around to making my portfolio mobile responsive (it even looks good on a stupid iPhone 5), then played around with Hammer.js and learned about tap events for mobile-responsiveness on W&W.

**Thoughts:** I have no clue why Hammer.js won't work. The only thing I can think of is that it isn't being maintained, so it's incompatable with newer versions of React (since every successful example I've seen is with version 16.8)? Touch events behaved very weirdly, further study is needed. Good thing we have the dpad!

### Day 9: March 29th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finalized (and fixed a bunch of stuff) in Wizards and Whiteboards for demo day tomorrow!

**Thoughts:** It is EXTREMELY difficult to make a page mobile-responsive without a CSS framework. Thank god for the heroes who maintain them!

### Day 10: March 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Presented at Demo Day! Also, solved the issue with users logging in and being able to get more than one salmon from the same NPC (though we decided to not tempt fate by deploying it just yet). For now it's stored in local storage, but ultimately we should really update the user schema in the databse to match our Redux state.

**Thoughts:** Demo Day was a lot of fun! It was awesome to have a game developer stop by our table and check out our app. Everyone said the idea was great and the game moved really smoothly, which was awesome to hear. We got a lot of advice to expand it to teach multiple subjects and/or multiple programming languages, so that's something to look forward to--possibly. I think I'm ready to work on other stuff for a while.

### Day 11: March 31st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Not much actual coding today, just planning and brainstorming for my Seattle Underground Tour game idea. 

**Thoughts:** Super excited to start working on another project! I think I really enjoy game development, so maybe I should look into that.

=========================================================================================

### Day 12: April 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: (roughly) wireframed the main game world and the landing page for the underground game. Troll game? I'm calling it the Troll game from now on. Also put together a mood board for Dan, and asked Emily to help with story development. 

**Thoughts:** This project could be really exciting! I'm sort of torn between leaning into the story aspect (and therefore definitely using React and Redux) and trying out a real game engine. I do really want to get more practice with React and Redux, so maybe save the game engine for the next one?

### Day 13: April 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built (most of) an API for a very simple job app tracker, then spent the rest of the day trying to write a Python script to parse XML to JSON. 

**Thoughts:** I've decided to build a small-scale MERN-stack app roughly every week while I work on larger projects and explore new technologies. Apparently, parsing XML to JSON in Python is impossbile without installing a third-party library. Apparently, so is writing a Python script to parse XML into JSON when you don't know Python. Sigh.

### Day 14: April 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: None to speak of

**Thoughts:** I got distracted by biscuits and gravy, and then it was time to leave for grandma's house. Today's date is 4/3/21 though, so we can't call it a total loss.

=========================================================================================

### Day 15: April 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wireframed a portfolio site for Moy and set a meeting to talk details, then finished my application tracker API. Planning to deploy tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how much better you get at finding silly errors quickly just from familiarity with the material. I make plenty of them, but they don't take a million years to debug anymore.

=========================================================================================

### Day 16: April 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved that silly JWT error, found some great articles about REST API best practices, and updated this week's API accordingly before deployment. Started adding the front-end layer using React and Material UI--got the pages and routing set up, then ran into a mysterious database error that derailed progress for the rest of the afternoon.

**Thoughts:** Heroku had its usual tantrum when I tried to deploy the API today, but I was able to solve it on my own in less than 20 minutes! That felt great, especially since Heroku and I have never seen eye to eye. Material UI seems SO cool, I'm super excited to dig in more tomorrow!

=========================================================================================

### Day 17: April 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got the signup form working on the application tracker, and added more specific error handling on the back end to help with debugging. 

**Thoughts:** I'm getting SO much faster at figuring out where my silly errors are that break the app. Not necessarily making fewer of them, but they now take a few minutes to fix on my own rather than a few hours with outside help.

### Day 18: April 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added Redux to job application tracker front-end. 

**Thoughts:** Man, don't ask me. I've got to get better at updating this every day.

### Day 19: April 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started building the API for the Seattle game

**Thoughts:** I hope my JSON string trick works with Redux state on the front end, will test in the next few days!

### Day 21: April 14th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got knocked out for a few days by the Grandma stuff, but I'm back! Finished the JavaScript Fundamentals course on freeCodeCamp and got most of the way through the ES6 course, plus a bunch of algorithms from the class repo. 

**Thoughts:** Algorithms are easier than I expected. Which is not to say they're easy. Just not as bad as I expected.

### Day 22: April 15th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Solved a few more class repo problems, created the front-end repo for the Seattle game, and now to finish the ES6 module on freeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts:** It was great to work collaboratively again. I'm much more motivated when I'm working in a group of people.
